# Viewport-Model-Library
This module allows users to easily display Models inside of Viewport Frames without having to worry about the size of the model!

# Changes
I added two functions to this Module:

* **GenerateViewport**

Which basically handles everything for you. Just pass through the Viewport Frame, Model, & (optionally) the Orientation for the Model!

* **CleanViewport**

This will delete any models already stored inside of the Viewport Frame. It's a very simple function, but I found myself using it quite often!
